inMemoryToken? Maybe use redist?
best practice for jwt expire time is 15 mins
But, the token will be 'silently refreshed' on client side.
How refresh token implemented on server side
what is httpOnly cookie
how long refresh token valid: 200 days
when force logout, invalidate refresh token for that user on server side. So the user will be logged out from every device.
Note: For SSR on authenticated pages, it is vital that that the domain of the auth API (and hence the domain of the refresh_token cookie) is the same as the domain of the SSR server. Otherwise, our cookies won't be sent to the SSR server!
